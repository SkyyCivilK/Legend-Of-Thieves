(will be built upon)


Dead Eldest Son:

Secretly killed the king, was hunted down and used for experiments by an evil organization father secretly formed.
He is not truly dead. But some might say his soul is. He was a loved prince, so his capture was covered up. 
His fiance is still doing everything to find out what happened to him. He is aware of his younger siblings, since he left clues for those investigating.

Snobby Elder Son:

While this son is very intelligent, he has classist views and his decisions only benefit his family and the nobility. 
He believes commonors killed his father, which is the source for his hatred. He had a very good relationship with both
his older brother and father, but after both of them gone he feels left in their shadow
Basically, he is snobby because he believe his loved ones left him behind. The only one who understands him is the Middle Daughter.

Middle Son:
Married off as a political pawn. He is very hedonistic and childish. He sees the world as his playground, and is not entirely aware he is being used.
At least his siblings don't realize he is aware he is being used. He believes if he follows his brother's (Elder) orders it will make his family happy.

Younger Middle Daughter:

A very loved princess who cares about the people. Despite differing philosophies than her Elder brother, she is closest to him. This is because after 
chaos in the palace, all children were sent to live with their maternal families and they share the same mother.


Youngest Son

(Should we add cutscenes for him killing the king? Like if there was some kind of sealed memory you found and you kinda got a flashback looking thing) YES
